# My Experience with GitHub Copilot
I am very surprised with how fast and accurate it works.\
Literally I just type a comment and it makes all the magic.
# Usage and Implementation
I used it to help me solve problem #4 which is very simple.\
Convert a decimal number into decimal via recursion without using any local variables.\
That is exactly what I wrote and it automatically suggested me a full function body.
# Final Comments
The program is very efficent and the technology overall is impressive!\
It is terrifying to see the level that AI has reached in programming skills.
